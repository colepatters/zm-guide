## Flint and Steel

The Flint and Steel is required to light the Nether Portal and enter the Nether.

### Gather Flint

In the Alley, break a specific gravel block by hitting it with your sword twice to get flint.

### Bake Iron Ore

This step involves surviving a ~120s lockdown in the Dressing Room. To begin, enter the Dressing Room, and hold the interact button on the furnace.

Once the lockdown is complete (you'll know when you hear the piston doors open back up), grab the iron ore from the furnace.
